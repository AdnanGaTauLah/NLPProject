"Okay, Im sorry.",5
"But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.",4
"So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.",4
"This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?",2

Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,4
"So, this isn't over?",4

I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,0

You dont need to smoke.,4
"Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?",1

Something to think about.,4
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!,3

You don't know anything.,0
Which I'm not.,4
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!,2
My Catholic friend is right.,4

Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?,6
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",4
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",4
Damn you 15s!,0
Why would the little girl creep you out?,0
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,0
"I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.",1
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",0
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,4

You guys feel safe.,4
"I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.",0
What are you looking at?!,0
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did",0
"Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.",4
"Fine, youre right.",4
Why?! Why cant she marry me?!,6
A hundred and forty-five pounds.,1
Okay?,4
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",4
"Uh, what was that?",6
"I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",0
Tell me about it.,4
Oh? Why not?,4
"Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?",4

"Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",1
"Uh sure, sure.",4
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",4
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",4
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",0
They dont look any bigger than me!,4
"Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.",4
Could've been a peach.,4
The guy left this.,4
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,0
"No, she doesnt.",4
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",4
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,4
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",5
"See look,",4
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",4
"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.",4
"You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!",0
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",5
Oh my God!,6
"Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?",2
We just want you to think it through.,4
Youre not the fan whos dying are you?,4
"Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?",3
I-I am going to,4
"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!",0
So its really a question of,4
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",4
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,4
"Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..",4
"No, the little girl creeps me out.",0
"Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!",6
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",4
"Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",5
"Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?",4
Dont you worry. I have nothing to hide.,4
Im on time!,3
I cant believe youre getting married!,3
Like what?,4
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",4
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",4
But you will always be the guy who peed on me.,1
I dont care.,4
"Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.",4
Love is the best medicine.,3
"Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.",3
"Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",4
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,5
Its me Rhonda!,4
I think I know who youre talking about.,4
Why do you want to see my hand?,4
"So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?",3
Sorry.,5
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",0
"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!",6
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,2
Uh Rach,4
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.",0
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, thats me.  Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.",4
You deal with it and move on!,3
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.,3
"Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.",4
Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.,4
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",4
How does that sound?,4
Hope you had a nice flight.,4
"Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",5
"But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.",4
"You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.",5
Its Joey!,6
All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,4
Phoebe! Come on! Lets go!  Come on!  Why arent you dressed yet?!,0
How about Joey... Pepponi?,4
"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.",1
"Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....",4
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?,5
"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",6
It's not.,4
"Yeah, it did.",3
All right!,3
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?,0
"All right, let's do it!",3
What?! Over a stupid room!,6
I love you Phoebe.,3
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",0
"Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.",5
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",5
Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.,3
"Yes, I made it!",3
It's okay to laugh right?,3
"Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.",3
"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?",6
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",4
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.,4
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.",4
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",4
Have you really done this before?,6
"Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!",6
"Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",4
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,0
They published my paper.,3
"Sure, its hard to forget!",4
Thats crazy.,6
"Well, I think it's perfect.",3
"You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",0
Tag!,0
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",4
I dont want to say.,4
You mean scared.,4
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",4
Done!,3
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,4
Shhhh!,0
Because Im dumping him today.,4
"Oh, its okay. I dont",4
Chandler!,6
"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",5
"Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.",4
"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.",1
"Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.",4
Really stupid.,0
"I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",0
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",4
And we didnt have sex.,4
