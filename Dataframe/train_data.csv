All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,4
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",4
"Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",4
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?",0

Maybe you need sex.,4
"Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",4
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",4
"No, it was a fight.",4
"Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!",0
Yes!,3
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",5

Bumpy?,6
What a wank!,0
"Hey, check me out, Im a slut!",3
"Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...",0

"I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.",5
People have got to finish their stories!,0
"See, yes.",4
"Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",4

"And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.",5
What? Honey.,4
"All right, II have to ask.",5

"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",5
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",0
"Well, thats just the way that goes.",4
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,4
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,0
"Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.",4
May I come in?,4
"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?",3

"Why, does she have a bad personality?",4
Really?,6
Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.,5
Did anybody call for security?,4

Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,4
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,4
Yeah I guess Ill let it go.,4
"Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff",4
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",5
Are you intrigued?,6
But,4
"Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!",3
"Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.",4
"I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",4
"Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.",5
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",5
"Oh, that sounds great.",3
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",4

"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",6
"Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.",5
"Ohh, thats a good one.",3
"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.",4
"Well, what did he do?",6

I would really love it if I could do both.,4
What the? What,6
No I'm not.,4
"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.",4
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",4

"So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",4
Hey Joey!,3
"Okay, its coffee.",4
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,5

"Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to",4
"Ill get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.",4
Thats not true!,0
"Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",4
"Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!",2

"Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!",3
Why?!,6
"Yeah, yeah, I was watching.",4
What are you doing tonight?,4
"Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big",3
"No, bribes.",4
"Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",4
"Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",4
Who cares? I repel women.,1
"Three, Two, One!",4

I know I do.,4
"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",0
Push!,3
"Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.",2
"Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!",1
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",4
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,4
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",4
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",4
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,4
Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow,3
"Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.",3
You would think.,4
"Yeah, I recognize the ankles!",4

I dont see the baby. Where is it?,4
"Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.",3
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!,0
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",4
"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",1
"Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?",1
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",4
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",0
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",4
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",5
"Come on Treeger, dont say that.",5
Get up!,0
"You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",1
The Hardy boys?,0
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",4
"Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",4
Nice to meet you.,4

"Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on",4
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",4

You think?,4
"Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!",0
Sure. Why not?,4
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",4
I totally dont know what youre talking about.,4
"Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?",6
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",4
'Tonight' tonight?,6
From PS-129!,4
That's,4
And there is Kevin.,4
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",0
Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.,4
"Now, dont hold back.",4
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.,6
"I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!",0
No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,4
Cut!,4
"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",4
I know.,4
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",4
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",4

"No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!",3
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",4
Its-its hot,4
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.",0
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!,6
"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!",0
Who is being loud?,0
Write a movie!,3
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",4

"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are",0
"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",4
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",4
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,4
You said she was bald.,0
"Oh, that is so sick.",1
"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",3
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.,4
Well its very unsettling.,5
"Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",5

"Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.",4
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",4

"Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.",5

"Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.",4
You just wanna each take one?,4
"This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.",3
Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,5
"Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right.",5
"Hey, did I do these neat enough?",4
"Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",5

"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",0
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!,3

You're kidding.,6
"Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.",1

It looks like a women's purse.,4
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",4
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,0
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!",5
I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.,2

"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",4
"Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.",4

I got new sheets!,3
"So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.",3
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",4
Wheres Chandler?,4
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",4
I love you too.,3
"Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.",4
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.,4
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?",4
"All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.",4
Every moment is precious.,5

Thats what Monica said.,4
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",0
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!""",1
"Chandler, theres a guy right over there.",4

"First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",4
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",0
Oh,4
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",4
Im not arguing with that.,4
"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!",3
Lucky sixes....,4
"Yeah, well, is that",4

There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions!,0
"Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.",4
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",0
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",4
Thank you for a delightful stay.,3
"Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!",6

She's distraught.,4
"Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!",6
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",4
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",5

"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.",3
"Oh, um, Chandler?",4

"Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?",4
"He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.",4

"Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.",4
"Yknow, give him my flower.",4
"Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.",5
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!,0
Okay.,4
"Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.",4
Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the,6

"Oh God, Im so sorry.",5
"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",6
Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.,4
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",4
I want to keep one.,4
"Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?",6
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,4
Its only fair!,0
Dont I deserve a few tears?!!,5
Then don't touch one!!,0
Ow!!,0
"Look at this, look.",0
Together? Like-like to people?,6
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",4
"Well, we should go.",4
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",0
Sure. Okay.,4
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",5
"Well uh, his answering machine was",5
Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.,4

There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.,4
"Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!",6
I am a gentle person.,4

And I too am just a love machine.,4
Thats not your regular dry cleaners.,4
"I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.",3
"Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.",5

"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",4
"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?",2
"All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.",4

What the hell happened on that beach?!,6
She really said that?,6
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",4
"Umm, Gene.",4
Come on! Joe!,3
"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!",6
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",5
"Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.",6
Hey-hey-hey!,3
Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information. Im a doctor.,4
"Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",0
Hey right!,6
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",4
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,5
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",4
I feel violated. And not in a good way.,1
Hello.,4

Oh hey!,6
I dont think the next patient is very far along.,4
"Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment",3
Will you call him?,4
"Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",0
This isnt funny!,0

"Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",4
"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",4

Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?,6
Marry me.,4
Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,5

"Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?",3
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.,6
For Chandler!,0
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.,3
I don't see why not.,4
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,4
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,0
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!""",0
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",4
Im gonna give you my weeks notice.,5
But its absolutely your decision.,4
"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?",5
"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",0
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,4
"And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?",4
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",4
But in very different ways.,4
"Um, can you roll your tongue?",4
"All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!",3
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",4
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",4
Like theyre taking it off the air?,6
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.",4
"Oh no, Bonnies the best!",3
Oh yeah!,3
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,4
The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.,4
"Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.",3
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.",5
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",4
Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.,6
