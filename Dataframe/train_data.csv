"Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.",4

"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.",5
"Way to be cool, man.",4
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.,4
"Oh, how did it go?",5
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,4
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",4
"Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",4
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",0
She's not much of a phone person.,4
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!",4
Oh there it is.,4
"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.",3
"No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.",4
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",4
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!,0
Hey!!,0
"Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",3
"Hey Monica, it's Joey!",3
"No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there.",4
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",4
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,4
Brenda a bee!,2
Are you intrigued?,6
"Oh my God, youre back!",6

The guy left this.,4
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",5
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",4
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",4
What do you mean?,6
Right?,4
Why should I help you?!,0
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",5
"You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!",3
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,0
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",4
"Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!",0

This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!,3
"All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.",4
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!,0
One more game?,4
Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,5
"Chandler, theres a guy right over there.",4
"How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",6
"I know, me too.",4
"Fine, youre right.",4
Is that too much to ask after six years?!,0
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!,3
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",4
Really stupid.,0
No-noReally?!,6
"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",0
Hands.,4
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,4
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?,4
Second date!,3
Did anybody call for security?,4
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,0
Come on you gotta have one!,6
I thought he was with you.,4
"Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.",4
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,5
"All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",4
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!,0
"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!",0
Are you kidding?,6
I shared my puddin which you man!,0
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.,4
Where are you Leslie?,2
"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",4
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",4
"No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!",5
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",4
"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.",1
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,0
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.,3
Yknow?,4
Are they in love?,3
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",4
"We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",4
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....",4
Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,5
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.,3
"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",4
Yeah! You wanna come?,3
What are we gonna do?,4
"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?",4
From PS-129!,4
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",5
I dont think hes the one Im sad about.,5
"Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.",2
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",5
"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",0
I don't see why not.,4
"Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",4
What is it?!,6
Why don’t you phase it out?,4
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",4
"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.",4
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,4
"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?",6
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",0
You bet! Whats the part?,3
I sure did.,4
"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are",0
If this is your idea of sexy talk?,6
Why?! Why cant she marry me?!,6
"Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.",5
He,4
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",5
You just wanna each take one?,4
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?,6
What contracts?,4
"Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!",3
I also said number one.,4
Okay!,3
Diverse.,4
"Oh, that is so not true.",4
"Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?",0
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!,6
Because we can remember them.,4
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.,3
"Yknow, give him my flower.",4
Whoa!  I kinda liked it.,3
"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?",4
"Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.",4
Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.,4
Could we talk about this later?,0
It looks like a women's purse.,4
You are so cute!,3
Go!!,0
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!,1
"Oh, DAMN IT!",0
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,4
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.,4
"Oh, poor Lily.",5
Im so sorry!,2
"No, bribes.",4
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",0
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,0
"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..",4
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.,0
"So, I hear, you hate me!",0
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,2
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?,0
"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",0
"Yeah, thats our baby.",3
Have fun.,4
I cant remember which sister.,5
"Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?",4
"Thank you, Happy Holidays.",3
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,4
What?! Excuse me!,6
...I can begin to trust you again.,0
Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!,0
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,0
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",0
"You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.",5
"Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.",4
"Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",5
"Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",4
"Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.",4
"I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.",0
"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?",2
Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.,3
"It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!",2
"Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.",6
"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",4
"Okay, who are you?",6
Dude! Dude!,6
Oh my God!,6
My Catholic friend is right.,4
Whoa! What?! Why?!,6
You said the baby.,4
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",4
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",4
Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!,1
What are you doing?,4
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",4
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",4
"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!",6
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?,3
"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",4
"Wow, you guys, this is big.",6
"All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!",3
What's up man?,4
"You cant ask us son, thats cheating.",4
"Yes, they can stay with us.",4
"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.",4
Do you know what Pheebs?,4
"Well, thats just the way that goes.",4
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",0
"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?",2
"Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!",6
"Ugh, can you believe that guy!",1
We just want you to think it through.,4
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,4
"Uhh, 9.",4
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.,4
No. No-no. No. What would,0
"Oh, by the  way.",4
"Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!",3
"Oh, that is so sweet!",3
Y'know what?,4
So where did you study?,4
"Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.",4
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",4
Whoo-hoo!,3
"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",0
"No, I mean happy.",4
Hows your room Rach?,4
No. But thanks.,4
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",4
Why did I have to start working out again?,1
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",4
"Yeah, sure?",4
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,5
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,4
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",5
I totally understand.  Can I,4
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",0
What?! Are you crazy?,6
"Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.",4
"And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?",0
Whats your favourite thing about summertime?,4
"Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!",1
"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.",5
Well its very unsettling.,5
"Oh well, its not so bad.",4
"Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?",5
So what does this mean?,4
Hmm.,4
"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid!",3
If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,4
Every moment is precious.,5
"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre",1
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",4
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",4
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",4
There's a forest right outside.,4
"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!",0
"Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",5
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",4
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",4
A lesson in the importance of unagi.,4
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,5
"Yknow its like uh, Biology!",4
Oh!,6
I do too.,5
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me!",0
"Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else",4
"Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.",5
"Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.",4
Rachel.,4
"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",5
One hundred percent natural!,3
"Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",4
Hi!,3

So its really a question of,4
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",4
I am a gentle person.,4
"Its uh, right through there.",4
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?,4
"All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.",4
"Oh, you got me.",4
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?,0
Wow!,3
"And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.",5
Come on Joey!!!,0
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",4
Two.,4
I stepped in something icky.,3
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",4
"Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.",2
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.",4
Wait a minute!,6
Its a trifle.,4
"Wait a second, I could star in it!",3
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!,0
"Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",4
Together? Like-like to people?,6
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",0
Damn you 15s!,0
"See you later, Gene.",4
Westminster Abbey!,3
What is the worse part?,4
You think?,4
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,4
"No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.",0
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",4
Someone in there?,4
Leslie?,4
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",4
"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",4
Im sorry!,5
I-I studied evolution.,3
"No, it was a fight.",4
"Ohh, I know one thing!",3
Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.,4
She is?,6
"Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.",4
My God!,6
"Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",4
"Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?",4
"Oh, really?",6
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!,4
"All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",4
$4.50 please.,4
"Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.",0
"Oh, it is.",4
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.,4
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",4
"About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but",1
Feel better?,4
I like it.,3
"Okay, its not, its not.",4
'Cause I-I got nothing!,0

"Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.",4
Whats wrong with you?,0
"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?",0
"Yeah, I do.",4
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,2
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",4
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.",1
Thats just the way it is.,4
Oh my God! I know who the father is,6
"Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!",0

"Well, if you want, you can work here.",4
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,0

Whos that?,6
"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",3
"Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.",4
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",4
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!""",0
"Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?",3
Hi.,4
"Can you, can you hang on a second?",4

"Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you!",3
"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.",6
"Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment",3
"Im telling you, you never gave them to me.",4
Tag!,0
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!,2
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",4
"Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!",3
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",4
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",4

"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",4
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",4
"Yes, you can, very much.",3
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?,6
"Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.",4
Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,5
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!,0
Maybe you should.,0
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,5
"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",5
Thanks a million.,3
"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",6
I-I do though.,5
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",4
Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,4
You mean scared.,4
Im gonna give you my weeks notice.,5
"Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!",6
"Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?",1
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?",4
"Wayne, Chandler.",4
"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",1
I know I do.,4
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.",4
"Oh, that would be Monica.",4
...I dunno.,4
"Hi, is Molly here?",4
Okay .,4
"Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?",3
Not once did we do that.,4
"All right, so we werent",4
"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.",4
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,0
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",4
Hell yeah! Ill marry you!,3
Thank you for a delightful stay.,3
I mean you definitely should do that.,4
"Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.",4
"Thank you, I need that.",3
It tastes like feet!,1
"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.",3
"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!",4
But what does that gonna do...,0
"I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",4
Can we please turn this off?,5
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",4
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",0
Because I'm very happy for him!  And,3
"Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",5
I got in there myself once.,4
It-it is broken!,0
"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?",6
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",5
Wait! What about Joey?,4
"Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....",4
But you will always be the guy who peed on me.,1
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.,3
Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!,0
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.,4
You are falling fast asleep.,4
I did not cry my eyes out!!,0
Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,5
"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?",5
"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!",6
I don't know.,4
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!,3
"I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!",0
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.,3
Thank you.,4
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,0
Was she happy you gave her the job?,4
"Okay, hating this.",1
Sure!,3
"Okay, heres where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone thats a wrap!",3
"Come on Treeger, dont say that.",5
"I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.",2
"I mean, I remember a time when",5
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,4
"Oh yeah, that's right!",0
Any luck?,5
I think I know who youre talking about.,4
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!,2
Little village people.,4
Im next!,0
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!,6
"Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.",5
Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!,6
"Oh... Italy, I think.",4
"Oh, um, Chandler?",4
"Well, okay. Would-would you get me a",4
May I come in?,4
I got my hair coloured!,3
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",4
I didn't think I could ever love again.,5
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?,6
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",4
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",4
Okay. All right.,4
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",4
We said six!,0
What do you got there?,4
"Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won’t stop crying.",5
I know. I like it up here.,3
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",4
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.,4
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,0
"Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",4
"Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.",4
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?",6
You don't know anything.,0
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!,6
Maybe you need sex.,4
But its absolutely your decision.,4
"Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.",4
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",0
"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",2
Ow!!,0
So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.,4
Come on! Joe!,3
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,5
I didnt think you were gay. I do now.,3
"Monica. Youve, youve done it right?",6
"Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.",4
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,0
I-I am going to,4
"Honey, I was wondering....",4
All right!,3
"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...",4
"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.",4
"Oh, what a fun office.",3
"Amazingly, that makes sense.",3
"Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?",3
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",0
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",4
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?,5
Could you press up too please?,4
Wow! Skates!,3
I cant believe youre getting married!,3
Nothing.,4
"Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",5
"Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",4
Thank you. All right.,4
"Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!",0
": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",0
I guess I didnt really think about it.,4
"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",4
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",0
Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?,6
"Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!",3
"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",2
"Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",4
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",5
I mean hi.,4
You're kidding.,6
"I tell ya, that has never happened before.",2
"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow?",4
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like,3
"Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.",3
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",4
"My best shoes, so good to me.",3
"Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.",3
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,0
"Sure, its hard to forget!",4
"Oh, come on!",5
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",4
"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",5
"Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I",4
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,4
"I mean,... how needy is that?",1
Is that Mark?,4
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",5
"Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",4
I cant believe Im going to lose this job!,5
"Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.",3
"Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",4
Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,0
Op.,4
"Because, I dont care.",4
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?,4
"Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.",5
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",0
"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",6
Who is being loud?,0
"Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.",4
No more Joey and Chans.,5
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.,3
Huh?,0
It was in my room all night!,0
You cant marry him!,0
"Yeah, I know.",5
"Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!",1
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",4
I cant find garbage bags!,0
"Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?",2
"Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.",6
You be cool.,4
Rachel always cries!,0
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!,3
"Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.",5
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",4
"Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.",5
You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.,4
Its Clint!,0
"Hey, what do you want to drink?",4
"Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.",4
I'm not a dropper!,0
Pants and a sweater?,0
Its my sister.,4
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",4
I can do that.,4
"Man,",4
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",4

And my husband  hes a lawyer!,0
"Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah! Im sorry Im getting all flingy.",6
What's goin' on?,4
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!,3
"Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he",4
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...",4
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",4
Why?,5
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",5
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.,4
"Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right.",5
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,4

Because were girls.,4
Now let it go!,0
"See look,",4
"Honey, we dont have any bears here.",4
"Thats it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.",3
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,4
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",0
"Oh, what? What was it?",6
Thats my wife!!! Get out!,0
Put Joey on the phone.,4
WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?,0
You talked to him. Are you crazy?,6
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,0
"Okay, look.",4
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",4
Sorry.,5
"If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.",4
Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.,5
Ah Joey.,4
She really said that?,6
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,4
Yes.,4
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",5
What is it? Hey!,5
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?",4
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",4
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!,3
Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!,3
"Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?",3
"But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.",4

"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",4
"No, where did you study acting?",4
"Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.",4
She's distraught.,4
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did",0
"Oooh, wrong answer.",4
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.,1
Um...  Done!,4
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",4
"Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",0
Because Im dumping him today.,4
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",4
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!,6
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,4
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?,6
Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.,3
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",5
"Actually, nectarines, but basically...",4

"See, I told you they dont swim.",4
"Oh God, do something.",0
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",4
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",5

"Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",1
"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",0
"Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?",4
"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.",1

"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",4
Here you go.,4
"Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!",3
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,4

"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!""",1
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",4
"Oh, just years of experience.",4
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",4
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",4
"No, I dont see it!",0
"As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.",3
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,3
"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",4

But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!,4
"Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?",6
"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",4
"Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?",4
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",4
"Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.",4
"Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",0
Why?!,6
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",4
Yeah baby!,3
Whats the matter?,4
Are you okay?,4
"Here we go, here we go.",4
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",4
"So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",4
Thats crazy.,6
"Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",4
Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.,4

"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",4
"Uh,",4
"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.",5
"Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on",4
"Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!",6
What could I have possibly done?!,0
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",4
That cup is mine!,0
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",5

"Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",4
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,0
"Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.",4
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",4
Sweet!,3
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!",0
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?,4
"All right, all right.",0
What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?,6
Stuart!,0
Something to think about.,4
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",4
"then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",4
"816, thank you!",3
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,4

"Why, what happened?",6
"Oh, youre switching apartments?",6
"No-no, its not okay!",5
"I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.",5
Yknow what? You are right?!,6
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",4
I mean do we not have as much fun?!,0

"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",4
"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",4
"Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",4
"Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.",0
"Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.",5
Why are there only two of you?,2
"Well, what did he do?",6
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,4
"Okay, good.",4
"Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.",6
Right!,6
"Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.",5
When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.,0
What are you guys doing?,4
"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?",0
"Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?",6
She mustve left.,4
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",4
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",4
"Yeah, sure, thatd be great.",4
"Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.",4
"All right, ok, I gotta go.",4
Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.,4
"Its between us and the sea, Ross!",4
"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",4
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",0

"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",4
"Like you, I dont even know where you work?",6
"I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?",3
"No, please.",4
Really? To what?,6
"July. Umm,",4
Relieved?,6
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.",4
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",4
Just dont pick up your phone.,4
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",0
"No, no, no. What was that?",6
I just want this to be  about what it is!,3
"Oh hey, Pheebs!",3
I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.,4
Well now-now youre just talking crazy.,3
"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.",3
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",4
"So, thats it?",6
And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.,4
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?",4
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",4
Who cares? I repel women.,1
He went out with my wife!,0
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",4
"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",5
Chandler that's crazy!,6
"Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!",5
"Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?",3
Woooo hoooo!!!,3
What happened?,6
Huh? Uh,4
"Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.",4
"Good, good, good, good, good.",3
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",0
I think you look fine.,4
Oh and I need to talk to you.,4
"Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",4
"I'm going,  and I'm gone.",4
No I'm not.,4
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.",5
"Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",4
Im sorry Joey.,5
Ohhh!,6
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...,2
"Yeah, like in a cab...",4
"So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?",4
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",4
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.,6
Bumpy?,6
Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the,6
"So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?",3
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",4
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?,4
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",4
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",4
"Oh, Larry.",4
"Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?",3
Good-bye Chandler Bing.,5

"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",4
Fine.,4
"Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.",3
What?,4
"So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?",6
If anything I'm making you look better!,3
What the? What,6
"If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",0
Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on your husband!,0
"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!",5
So why cant the three of us go out together?,4
"I mean, what about those",4
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!,0
Cant I just look at the handles on them?,4
That bitch!,0
Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?,6
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,0
"Well, up yours too!",0
Are you mocking me?,0
"So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.",3
"Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?",4
"Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.",4
"Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross!",0
"No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?",2
"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.",4
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",4
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",4
I just have to clean that up.,4
I have no name.,4
"Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.",3
I think I know whats going on here.,1
"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!",4
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.,3
You mind if I,4
"Oh God, Im so sorry.",5
"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.",4
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",4
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,0
Then why are you smoking?,1
Was that story over?,4
"No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!",0
"Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.",4
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",4
"You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",4

"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",4
"Okay, good bye!",0
"Oh, are you sure?",6
"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",4
We're in a relationship?,6
"And plus, it'll give me something to do.",4
"I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.",0
How ya feelin?,4
But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.,2
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]",4
"Why, exactly?",6
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",0
I totally understand.,4
What did he say?,4
I didnt mean to scare you.,5
"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",6
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",5
"Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.",3
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",4
"Oh no-no believe me, Im leaving as soon as possible!",4
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!,3

"Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to",4
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,4
"Yeah, get out!",0
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",4
Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,5
"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",0
Theres just so much pressure.,0

"Well, I just called Joshua",4
"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",6
Like what?,4
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",4
Its like the end of an era!,5
Oh please.,4
"Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",4
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",4
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",0
"Oh, youre welcome a million.",3
"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.",0

Its only fair!,0
"Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",5
"Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",3
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.,4
"Alright, alright, alright.",4
"Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.",4
Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?,4

"Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!",6
I can't wait to be with you!,3
"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.",3
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",5
"The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.",4
"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!",0
Or that.,4
"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",4

How does that sound?,4
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,0

"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",0
"Hey, funny you should call.",3
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",4
"So, does that mean the audition is off?",5
Im an actor. Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.,4
"Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.",4
This is going in your book?,6
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!",0
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,4
Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.,4

Wow.,6
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!,0
Hey! Whats up?,4

"Oh hey, Ross.",4
"I know, but look at me: all tan.",3
Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either.,4
It is.,4

"Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",0
"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.",4
"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?",4
They’re not listening too me?,6
Whose is it?,4
No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,4
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",0
You cant leave! I have your shoe!,5
"Well, I don't know what else to do.",5
"Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.",3
"All right, II have to ask.",5
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",4

Chandler what do you say?,4
What do you need?,4
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,4
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!,6
And I too am just a love machine.,4
There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions!,0

Dont you have to use the bathroom?,4
"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?",4
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,3
"Well uh, his answering machine was",5
"Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.",4
Dont care what people say.,3
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",0
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",4
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,4
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",4
Thanx.,4
WHAT IS IT?!,0

"I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",0
Ewww!,1
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,4
"Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.",3
"Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.",4
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",4
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.,3
Hmm?,4
"Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",3
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,0
"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",6
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",0
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",4
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,4

"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",4
"Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!",4
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",0
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",4

Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like,4
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,0
Sit.,4

"Yeah, but without the costumes.",4
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!,1
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.",0
I bet he can.,4
Guess what?,4
"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",4
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",0
Eh.,3
"Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!",3
"Three, Two, One!",4
I dont think so.,4

"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",4
"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.",1
"Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.",4
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",4
You completely stole my answer!,0
"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.",1
"Yeah, I guess so.",4
But in very different ways.,4
"Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey.",4
Hey! He beat ya.,3
You forget how many great songs Heart had.,4
More tea?,4
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",4
"Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",4
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",0
Ahh. Thank you!,3

And I don't even know how it happened.,5
"Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.",5
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,0
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,4
Cut!,4
"What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?",6
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",0
Hey.,4
